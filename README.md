This is the source code.

If you ever want to compile it yourself for whatever reason,




install .NET SDK 8.0 and put all of these files into a folder.

Then open the folder using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio and press F5 to build and run it (and click any confirmation boxes).

Afterwards, open the bin folder at the file explorer on the left, and right-click the 'Flashycard console edition.exe' and click 'Reveal in File Explorer'.

Finally, just double-click the Flashycard console edition.exe.


Congrats! You just compiled and ran Flashycard directly from the source!
